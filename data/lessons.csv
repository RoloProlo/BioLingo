1.1.1,"The body's defense mechanism is a system that protects us from harmful invaders like bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other pathogens that can cause illness. It functions to detect and eliminate these threats to maintain our health. This defense system is often referred to as the immune system, and it has several layers of protection that work together.",What are defense mechanisms?
1.1.2,"First off, the Physical Barriers. These are the first line of defense and include:
Skin: A tough, protective outer layer that blocks most pathogens from entering the body. (1)
Mucous Membranes: Found in places like the nose, mouth, and throat, these trap microbes and foreign particles before they can get inside. (2)
Secretions: Substances like sweat, tears, and saliva contain enzymes that can destroy bacteria. (3)",Three main defense mechanisms
1.1.3,"Secondly, the Innate Immunity: This is the second line of defense and refers to the immune responses that are present from birth. It acts quickly and nonspecifically to fight off pathogens. Key components include:
White Blood Cells (e.g., phagocytes): These cells can engulf and destroy pathogens.
Inflammation: A process where injured or infected tissue becomes red, swollen, and warm, helping to isolate and destroy invaders.
",Three main defense mechanisms
1.2.1,"Infections occur when pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites enter the body, multiply, and begin to cause harm. This initial phase often has few or no symptoms, but the body starts its immune response to counter the threat.",What is an infection?
1.2.2,"Sickness (or disease) is the result of the body's response to an infection. Symptoms like fever, inflammation, and fatigue occur as the body attempts to fight the invading pathogens. These symptoms are signs that the immune system is actively working.",What is sickness?
1.2.3,"The difference between infection and sickness lies in their definitions: infection is the presence and multiplication of pathogens, while sickness refers to the body's symptomatic response to these invaders. An infection may not always result in sickness if the immune system quickly eliminates the threat.",Difference between infection and sickness
1.3.1,"Pathogens are microorganisms that can cause disease. These include bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Each type has unique characteristics and ways of invading the body. Bacteria, for instance, are living cells that can multiply on their own, while viruses need host cells to reproduce.",What are pathogens?
1.3.2,"Bacteria are single-celled organisms that exist everywhere around us. While some bacteria are beneficial, others cause infections like strep throat or urinary tract infections. Viruses, unlike bacteria, cannot survive without a host and are responsible for diseases such as the flu or COVID-19.",Types of pathogens: Bacteria and viruses
1.3.3,"Fungi and parasites are also common pathogens. Fungi cause infections such as athlete's foot or ringworm, while parasites like protozoa or worms invade a host to obtain nutrients, often causing harm. These pathogens can be transmitted through various means, including contaminated water, soil, or direct contact.",Types of pathogens: Fungi and parasites
2.1.1,"Adaptive immunity is the part of the immune system that provides a highly specific response to pathogens and remembers them for future defense. Unlike innate immunity (the body's general, non-specific defense), adaptive immunity targets specific invaders such as bacteria, viruses, or toxins. This system takes time to develop after an initial exposure to a pathogen, but once it does, it becomes much more effective in protecting the body.",What is adaptive immunity?
2.1.2,"An antigen is any substance that the immune system recognizes as foreign or harmful, triggering an immune response. Antigens can be found on the surface of pathogens like viruses, bacteria, and fungi, or even on non-pathogenic substances like pollen. When these antigens enter the body, they signal that something abnormal is present, which prompts the immune system to respond. In adaptive immunity, antigens play a crucial role because they allow the immune system to recognize and specifically target the invading pathogen.",What is an antigen
2.1.3,"Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that are central to adaptive immunity. There are two main types of lymphocytes involved in this process:
B cells: These produce antibodies, which are proteins that specifically bind to antigens to neutralize the pathogen or mark it for destruction by other immune cells.
T cells: These include helper T cells, which support the immune response by activating other immune cells, and cytotoxic T cells, which directly kill infected or cancerous cells. Lymphocytes ensure that the adaptive immune response is targeted and specific to the invading pathogen, providing a stronger defense than the body’s general, non-specific defenses.",What is a lymphocyte
2.2.4,"One of the key features of adaptive immunity is immunological memory. After the immune system encounters a pathogen for the first time, it creates memory B and T cells that ""remember"" the specific antigens of the pathogen. If the same pathogen invades the body again, these memory cells respond much more quickly and efficiently. This faster response can often prevent the pathogen from causing illness or reduce the severity of the disease, which is the principle behind how vaccines work—by training the immune system to recognize specific pathogens without causing the illness itself.",Immunological memory
1.3.1,"Viruses are non-living pathogens that cannot survive or reproduce on their own. They need to infect host cells in order to start being active, such as to replicate. Unlike bacteria, viruses don't have the cellular machinery to grow or divide independently. Instead, they hijack a host cell's machinery to make copies of themselves, leading to the death or damage of the infected cell. When outside a host, viruses are essentially inactive particles, waiting to find a cell to infect.",What is a virus?
1.3.2,"Viruses contain genetic material, either DNA or RNA, which carries instructions for building the virus. When this genetic material mutates, the virus changes, including its antigens, which can make vaccines less effective. Unlike body cells, which have mechanisms to correct DNA errors, viruses mutate more often because they lack these correction systems, especially RNA viruses, leading to rapid changes.",What is a virus made of?
1.3.3,"There are three key mechanisms. Firstly using interferons, which are proteins that slow viral replication by signaling nearby cells to boost their defenses, and secondly cytotoxic T-cells, which identify and destroy virus-infected cells to prevent further spread. Together, interferons limit the virus's ability to spread, while cytotoxic T-cells directly eliminate infected cells. Lastly B-cells produce antibodies that specifically target viruses by recognizing viral antigens.",Bodily virus defence
1.3.4,"Bacteria are living organisms that can survive in many places; on your skin, in your mouth, in your gut, and even on surfaces like door handles. Unlike viruses, bacteria can live and reproduce on their own without needing a host. Some are harmful and cause infections, like strep throat, while others are helpful, like the bacteria in our stomach that aid digestion.",What is a bacteria?
1.3.5,"The body fights harmful bacteria using two main defenses: Immune Cells: Phagocytes (from innate immune system) patrol the body, find, and engulf bacteria to destroy them. Antibodies: Produced by B-cells, antibodies target specific bacteria by recognizing their unique markers (antigens) and either neutralize them or mark them for destruction. Bacterial infections are treated with antibiotics, which kill bacteria or stop their growth. It’s essential to use antibiotics wisely to prevent antibiotic resistance.",Bodily defense bacteria
