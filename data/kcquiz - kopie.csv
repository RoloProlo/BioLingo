"1.1","What are defense mechanisms in the immune system?","They are physical, mechanical, and chemical barriers the body uses to protect against pathogens.","They are only physical barriers such as skin that prevent any pathogens from entering the body.","They refer to any immune cell action that directly kills pathogens.","They involve only mechanical actions like coughing and sneezing without chemical support.","Incorrect. Defense mechanisms include physical, mechanical, and chemical defenses.","Incorrect. Defense mechanisms include more than just immune cell actions.","Incorrect. Mechanical actions are part of defense mechanisms but they work together with physical and chemical barriers."
"1.1","Which system of the body is responsible for defense mechanisms against pathogens?","The immune system protects the body by recognizing and fighting off pathogens.","The circulatory system manages the defense mechanisms of the body.","The nervous system controls all defenses against pathogens.","The digestive system acts as the main defense against harmful microorganisms.","Incorrect. The circulatory system transports blood but does not manage defense mechanisms.","Incorrect. The nervous system controls body functions but not immune defense.","Incorrect. The digestive system protects in some ways, but the immune system is the primary defense."
"1.2","What is the difference between an infection and a sickness?","Infection is when pathogens enter and multiply; sickness is the body's response like fever and inflammation.","Infection and sickness are the same and refer to the body being unwell.","Sickness happens before an infection begins.","Infection refers to the immune system fighting back after sickness has already started.","Incorrect. Infection and sickness are related but not the same thing.","Incorrect. Sickness is a result of the body's response to infection.","Incorrect. Infection happens before the body shows signs of sickness."
"1.2","How does the body respond to an infection?","The body activates its immune response, including inflammation and increased temperature to fight off the infection.","The body stops all immune responses and waits for the infection to pass.","The body produces new organs to help fight infections directly.","The body ignores the infection and relies on external medications for recovery.","Incorrect. The body actively fights infections using immune responses.","Incorrect. No new organs are produced during infections.","Incorrect. The body itself takes active steps to combat infections."
"1.3","What is the primary function of the immune system?","To protect the body by identifying and destroying harmful pathogens.","To improve digestion by breaking down food.","To produce new cells in the body continuously.","To store energy for future use.","Incorrect. The immune system fights pathogens, not digests food.","Incorrect. Cell production is not the immune systemâ€™s primary function.","Incorrect. The immune system is not responsible for storing energy."
"1.3","How does the immune system detect pathogens?","It uses immune cells like phagocytes to recognize and attack foreign invaders.","It produces hormones that detect pathogens in the blood.","It relies on the nervous system to identify harmful microorganisms.","It sends signals to the digestive system to digest any pathogens found.","Incorrect. Hormones are not involved in detecting pathogens.","Incorrect. The nervous system does not play a direct role in detecting pathogens.","Incorrect. The immune system does not rely on the digestive system to eliminate pathogens."
"2.1","What is the first line of defense against pathogens?","Physical barriers like skin, mechanical defenses like coughing, and chemical barriers like stomach acid.","The production of antibodies to fight off any pathogen in the body.","The destruction of infected cells by T-cells in the body.","Inflammation is the first defense that responds immediately to all pathogens.","Incorrect. Antibodies are part of the adaptive immune response, not the first line of defense.","Incorrect. T-cells are part of the adaptive response, not the initial defense.","Incorrect. Inflammation is a secondary response, not the first line of defense."
"2.1","How do chemical barriers protect the body from pathogens?","They neutralize or destroy pathogens with substances like enzymes or stomach acid.","They act as physical shields that trap pathogens inside the body.","They signal immune cells to ignore the pathogens and focus on other body functions.","They prevent pathogens from entering the bloodstream by creating mucus.","Incorrect. Chemical barriers do not trap pathogens; they destroy them.","Incorrect. Chemical barriers attack pathogens directly, not by signaling cells to ignore them.","Incorrect. Mucus is part of the mechanical defenses, not the chemical barrier."
"2.2","What is the role of macrophages in the immune system?","Macrophages engulf and digest pathogens, clearing infections from the body.","Macrophages signal other immune cells to produce more antibodies.","Macrophages release toxins that kill all cells around an infection.","Macrophages form a barrier around the pathogen to keep it in one place.","Incorrect. Macrophages engulf pathogens directly rather than signaling for antibodies.","Incorrect. Macrophages digest pathogens, they do not release toxins indiscriminately.","Incorrect. Macrophages do not form barriers; they remove pathogens by digesting them."
"2.2","How do phagocytes help protect the body from infections?","Phagocytes ingest and destroy pathogens before they can spread.","Phagocytes create antibodies to directly target specific infections.","Phagocytes signal the adaptive immune system to begin producing new immune cells.","Phagocytes increase the body's temperature to help kill pathogens.","Incorrect. Phagocytes do not create antibodies; they engulf pathogens.","Incorrect. Phagocytes are part of the innate immune system and do not signal for new cells.","Incorrect. Phagocytes do not regulate body temperature."
