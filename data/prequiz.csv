Introduction to Defense Mechanisms,What is the primary purpose of the body's defense mechanisms?,To protect against pathogens and foreign substances,To regulate body temperature,To facilitate nutrient absorption,To control muscle movements
Introduction to Defense Mechanisms,Which of the following represents the body's first line of defense against infectious agents?,Physical barriers like skin and mucous membranes,White blood cells,Antibody production,Fever induction
Innate Immunity,Innate immunity is characterized by which of the following features?,It provides a rapid but nonspecific response to pathogens,It adapts and improves its response upon repeated exposure,It exclusively targets viruses,It relies on the production of specific antibodies
Innate Immunity,Which of these is NOT a component of the innate immune system?,Memory B cells,Skin and mucous membranes,Natural killer cells,Inflammatory response
Adaptive Immunity,Adaptive immunity differs from innate immunity in that it:,Provides a specific response to specific antigens,Responds more rapidly upon first exposure,Lacks immunological memory,Is effective only against bacterial infections
Adaptive Immunity,Which cells are primarily responsible for the adaptive immune response?,B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes,Red blood cells and platelets,Neutrophils and eosinophils,Macrophages and dendritic cells
Immunity,The process of vaccination works by:,Stimulating the immune system to develop memory cells without causing disease,Introducing antibiotics into the body to fight pathogens,Directly killing pathogens present in the bloodstream,Blocking the innate immune response to reduce inflammation
Immunity,Passive immunity can be acquired through:,Transfer of antibodies from mother to fetus through the placenta,Exposure to a disease-causing organism,Vaccination with a weakened pathogen,Activation of the body's own immune system to produce antibodies
Blood Groups and Rh Factors,Why is matching ABO blood groups crucial during blood transfusions?,Mismatched blood can cause the recipient's immune system to attack the transfused blood cells,It prevents the spread of infectious diseases,It ensures proper oxygen transport in the recipient's body,Mismatching has no significant effect on the recipient
Blood Groups and Rh Factors,An individual with type O- blood is considered a universal donor because:,"Their blood lacks A, B, and Rh antigens, reducing the risk of immune reaction","They have all possible antigens, making their blood compatible with all recipients","Their plasma contains all antibodies, aiding the recipient's immunity",Their blood cells are larger and more durable
Viruses and Bacteria,A key difference between viruses and bacteria is that viruses:,Can replicate only inside a host cell,Are larger than bacteria,Have a cell wall made of peptidoglycan,Are always beneficial to humans
Viruses and Bacteria,Antibiotics are ineffective against viral infections because:,Viruses lack the cellular structures targeted by antibiotics,Viruses have protective outer shells that repel antibiotics,Antibiotics strengthen viruses,Viruses mutate too rapidly for antibiotics to be effective
